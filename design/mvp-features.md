# MVP Features

The stuff that is implemented when we send the first round of invites

Things to test:
 1. do people want something that makes writing easier?
 2. are people more motivated to write if they can see other people writing?
 3. do people want to see stats on the engagement of reps with their electorates?

 - users can send emails to reps
 - users can send letters to reps
 - users can register when they get a link with a code
 - users can tell the system when they get a letter reply
 - users receive follow up emails to request updated letter status
 - users can view statistics on reps
 - users can choose which rep to write to when there are more than one for their search criteria
 - rep can be inferred from postcode / registered address
   by default we choose the most likely electorate, but leave
   an option to the user change this is they know it is wrong
 - MP replies are sent direct to user@openletter.org.au
 - letters marked public are publicly viewable
